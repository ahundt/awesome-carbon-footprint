A curated step by step guide to reduce your carbon footprint. Please share! :-)

# 0. Calculate your Carbon Footprint to figure out where you are now. 
https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/consider-your-impact/carbon-calculator/

1. Save your results to a folder in your computer, naming the file with today's date.
2. What makes the biggest difference in your carbon footprint? Tackle that first!
3. Set a repeating calendar reminder for every 6 months, and make sure to go through this list at least once a year and update your progress folder to see how you are doing. Particularly check the big items, the cost might have dropped!
4. Nobody is perfect, just try to address every item you are able to, and make sure you improve every time you come back to this list.

# 1. Reduce first! Make a plan for your work and home to reduce biggest carbon sources

1. Tackle the big impact stuff carbon sources first, just like you would tackle big expenses when tightening your monthly $ budget.
2. Can you calculate and reduce the carbon impact of your workplace? Can you suggest your office consider it? Can you teleconference instead of flying?
    1. Flights are among the highest carbon impact activities, reduce or offset them.
3. Buy new or slightly used high efficiency vehicles/equipment (furnace, low-flow showerhead, water heater, refrigerator, etc)
    1. New stuff can lead to huge emissions reductions over 5+ years if they increase efficiency! (It can save $ too)
    2. Be sure to compare the actual numbers such as [miles per gallon](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/), [wattage per hour (electricity)](https://www.reliant.com/en/residential/save-energy/tips-to-lower-your-electricity-bill/electricity-consumption-comparison.jsp), and gallons per minute (shower heads)!
    3. Find highly efficient models then pick your purchase from among those! Don't just look for an energy star rating, compare the quality of that rating.
    4. Put all new equipment into the calculator to make sure it actually reduces your carbon footprint.
    6. Improving something big that takes a lot of energy is most important! Think about the mining, coal, natural gas, oil and water being used on an continous basis for all items that require electicity or fuel.
    7. When you replace
        1. furnace: Make sure you upgrade from a furnace with 90% efficiency to a 96%+ (usually ~$500 extra)
        2. roof: Call a company which assess if adding solar panels will save you money https://sunrun.com https://www.tesla.com/solarpanels
4. Cars - Avoid owning cars if possible. Otherwise 
    1. If you already [own a gas guzzler or old car you might want to ditch it](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/09/04/its-never-too-late-to-ditch-your-gas-guzzler/) for something [more efficient](https://fueleconomy.gov), and [safer too](https://www.good.is/articles/car-crash-safety) here is some [NHTSA data for safety facts](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811825).
    2. If you need to buy a car get the most fuel efficient car that meets your needs, prefereably electric and used if possible. 
    3. If you only need to transport big stuff a few times a year get a smaller car, rent for big stuff.
    4. Extracting gasoline from the ground for your current car takes a lot of energy, making a new electric car from dirt takes less! [ucsusa.org/evlifecycle](ucsusa.org/evlifecycle) [Union of Concerned Scientists Electric Car Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9m9WDxmSN8)
    5. You can make a smaller more efficient car work! What if you get a more efficient car then adapt for the few times a month you need more? Try a [hitch mounted rack](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Series-63153-Mounted-Carrier/dp/B001G4Z5J0/), [renting a trailer from U-Haul](https://www.uhaul.com/Trailers/), or rent a larger vehicle as needed.
5. Rent or own your place? Seal it up!
    3. Seal all those leaks to the outside in your apartment/house. [Great stuff expanding foam](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002YX98O/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_3jJpCbE88Z7K0) is helpful.
    1. Do an [energy upgrade to your house/apartment](https://www.energy.gov/articles/living-comfortably-consumer-s-guide-home-energy-upgrades) or suggest it to your landlord.
9. If you can, first eat less meat, then eat poultry over red meat. You don’t need to be a vegetarian/vegan, every little bit helps because eating 50% less meat and ensuring what you do eat uses 50% of the energy means you get 75% of the gain that comes from being vegan. ![https://www.ewg.org/meateatersguide/a-meat-eaters-guide-to-climate-change-health-what-you-eat-matters/climate-and-environmental-impacts/](http://www.globalstewards.org/images/greenhouse-emissions-per-type-of-food.jpg)
3. Change your electricity to a renewable supplier https://www.epa.gov/greenpower/locate-green-power-suppliers. This is one of the quickest!
11. Think about what might you do or use which is not listed here.
12. Do items not apply to you? Send this to your landlord, boss, parents, colleagues, etc!

# 2. Offset what you won't reduce or can't reduce

1. Take the carbon footprint from #1 and order a subscription from https://www.atmosfair.de/en/offset/fix
2. If a subscription is too much, at least offset your flights each year (same link).
3. Atmosfair’s projects are all either certified or working towards [gold standard certification](https://www.goldstandard.org/)
4. A 2018 summary of the how/what/why of carbon offsets is at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/carbon-offsets.pdf.
5. Offsets are still effective in 2019 but become less effective every year
# 3. Reuse! Replace single use items with reusable versions where you can. 

1. You can hand a travel mug to the staff at any coffee shop, they'll put your drink in there, it even works at gas stations!
2. Reusable towels over paper towels
3. Bring reusable bags shopping but only if you'll use them at least 100 times. Repeatedly buying reusable bags is actually worse!
4. Choose eateries where you don’t throw the plates out.
